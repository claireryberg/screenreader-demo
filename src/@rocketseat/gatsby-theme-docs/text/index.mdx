# Introduction

This demo site was put together using the Rocket Docs theme for Gatsby. It is not itself inherently 
accessible, so don't necessarily look to it as an example of how to "correctly" code a site like this.

Note: given that this page is for screen reader demo purposes, not much time was spent on the styling.
